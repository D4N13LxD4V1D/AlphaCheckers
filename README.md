# AlphaZero framework for the game of German Checkers

This framework was used for research of our paper [Deep Learning and the Game of Checkers](https://mendel-journal.org/index.php/mendel/article/view/163)


### IMPORTANT NOTE

This is the code repository for my little project from 2019 called AlphaCheckers based on this [framework](https://github.com/AppliedDataSciencePartners/DeepReinforcementLearning). This is repo is used for sharing and codekeeping and **I will not be working on it any further**
